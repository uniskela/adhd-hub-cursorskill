# ADHD Hub MCP tools (reference)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `session_digest` | Compact open threads (id, title, goal, focus, next, blocked, resume, `completion`) + reminders + `guidance` (expected versions / last local verification status) |
| `report_guidance_health` | Record versions **you** verified locally (doctor / setup `--check` / reading markers). Hub cannot inspect the client FS |
| `check_overlap` | Rank open threads vs a query (uses goal/title/focus, not full PROGRESS.md) |
| `resolve_project` | Map cwd → project slug (prefer `create_if_missing=false` for initial lookup) |
| `list_projects` / `upsert_project` | Project registry |
| `list_open_threads` | Browse unfinished work |
| `upsert_thread` | Create/update a thread (one finishable outcome; optional goal/focus/next) |
| `upsert_progress` | Update structured active state + PROGRESS.md; pass `thread_id` when known; `force_new_thread` for a new outcome; may return `needs_thread_selection` |
| `pause_thread` | Pause unfinished work; set concrete next resume step |
| `mark_done` | Close a known thread when `completion.ready` / Goal done; do not retry if rejected for unfinished work |
| `set_reminder` | once / session / daily / random |

## Keeping skills / AGENTS current

Hub owns version pins (`<!-- adhd-hub:guidance-version:N -->`, `hub_skill_version`, `hub_guidance_version`). Detection is **local**:

1. Operator: `adhd-hub doctor --project .` (also records verification on Hub when credentials work)
2. Repair AGENTS only: `adhd-hub setup . --refresh`
3. Project-scoped Hub skills (deterministic, no LLM): `adhd-hub sync-project .` or `adhd-hub setup . --project-skills`
4. Opt-in global Hub skills: `adhd-hub setup . --install-skills` (or Marketplace plugin update — see [Cursor plugin skill sync](https://github.com/uniskela/adhd-hub/blob/main/docs/cursor-plugin-skill-sync.md))
5. Agent: if `session_digest.guidance.status` is not `last_verified_current`, mention once + point at doctor/refresh; after a local check, optionally `report_guidance_health`

## Progress routing

- Explicit `thread_id` → update exactly that thread
- `force_new_thread=true` → always create a new outcome thread
- No unfinished threads → create when `create_thread_if_missing`
- One clearly matching unfinished thread (goal/title) → reuse
- Multiple unfinished / ambiguous → `needs_thread_selection` with candidates (does not silently pick newest)

Structured fields: `goal`, `focus` (exactly one), `next_steps` (max 3), `blocked_reason` (omit when empty), `resume_step`.

Setup: configure this plugin’s MCP variables `ADHD_HUB_MCP_URL` (your Hub `/mcp` endpoint) and `ADHD_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN` (Bearer matching the Hub server). Require HTTPS for every non-loopback connection unless the entire path is protected by an authenticated encrypted overlay such as Tailscale. Unencrypted HTTP is allowed only on loopback; a private LAN or Docker network alone does not protect bearer tokens. Browser session cookies only authorize REST, not MCP.

**Verify after install:** confirm Cursor’s MCP panel lists server `adhd-hub` with tools such as `resolve_project` and `session_digest`, and/or `curl` health on your Hub base URL (`GET /api/health`). Do not rely on Hub-repo-only scripts such as `probe_mcp.py`. Never paste credentials into progress notes. The Hub stores only the requested project/thread/reminder fields in its configured local SQLite/Markdown directory; this protocol sends no full transcripts.

Hub UI: `{ADHD_HUB_PUBLIC_URL}/ui` when configured. See [uniskela/adhd-hub](https://github.com/uniskela/adhd-hub) for server install and docs.
